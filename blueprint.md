# iHealthStack Blueprint

## Overview

iHealthStack is a web application that helps users discover and build personalized health stacks. It provides a curated list of health stacks, each with a specific purpose, such as cognitive enhancement, sleep and recovery, and anxiety and stress relief. Users can browse the stacks, view their components, and purchase them. They can also save their favorite stacks to their profile for future reference.

The application also features an AI-powered chatbot that acts as a concierge, helping users find the optimal health stack for their needs. The chatbot can answer questions about the stacks, provide recommendations, and guide users through the process of building their own personalized stack.
